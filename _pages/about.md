The Eternal Student
======
Sofyan Sahrom here, the Eternal Student. 

I am a mortal that believes we either hypertophy (grow) or atrophy (decay). One way to grow is to constantly learn and devlope oneself.

Professionally
======

I am an athletic development specialist with a belief that high performance is achieved through an integrated multi-disciplinary approach, based on actual data and not just pure empirical "say-so". 

I passionately believes in a long-term and data-driven approach to development for both athlete and coach.

- As an S&C Coach, I have had the honor of coaching athletes throughout the full training spectrum from developmental youths to elite adults. 

- As a Sports Science practitioner, I have contributed through several sports science disciplines and am a firm believer of an integrated/interdisciplinary approach. 

- As a Data Analyst, I am looking to develop further into machine learning and its integration in sports performance

Experienced in the area of Biomechanics, Performance Analysis, Data Analytics and Strength and Conditioning. 

"Always Learning, Always Growing"

I am honored to be recognised as a SkillsFuture Fellow for 2018.
